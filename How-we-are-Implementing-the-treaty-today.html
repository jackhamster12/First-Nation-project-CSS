    This fall has been marked with acts of violence and intimidation
    by non-Indigenous commercial fishers against members of the
    Miâ€™kmaq Nation in Nova Scotia seeking to carry out their treaty
    right to fish. These actions, and the accompanying inaction on the
    part of law enforcement officials, are a stark reminder that
    racism remains a persistent part of Canadian society. They also
    point to another significant barrier to the processes of
    decolonization and reconciliation the ongoing failure of the
    federal and provincial governments in Canada to uphold and
    implement treaties between Indigenous Peoples and the Crown.
