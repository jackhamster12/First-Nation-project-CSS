    <p class="center-text">
      This fall has been marked with acts of violence and intimidation
      by non-Indigenous commercial fishers against members of the
      Miâ€™kmaq Nation in Nova Scotia seeking to carry out their treaty
      right to fish. These actions, and the accompanying inaction on
      the part of law enforcement officials, are a stark reminder that
      racism remains a persistent part of Canadian society. They also
      point to another significant barrier to the processes of
      decolonization and reconciliation the ongoing failure of the
      federal and provincial governments in Canada to uphold and
      implement treaties between Indigenous Peoples and the Crown.

    <h3 class="center">What are Land Claim Agreements?</h3>
    <p class="center-text">
      Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claims
      Agreements, are concluded over long periods of time and contain
      a high level of detail. These sophisticated agreements are
      typically tripartite, including Indigenous organizations or
      nations, the Crown, and provincial/territorial governments as
      signatories.

      Why are the First Nation peoples not happy with the Government?

    <!--my paragraph about Indigenous people's strangles-->
    <p class="center-text">
      Indigenous people in Canada face substantial socioeconomic
      inequality compared with non-Indigenous Canadians due to impacts
      of colonisation, such as forced removal from their land and
      communities. Thousands of Indigenous children have died in
      residential or industrial schools.

      Why do the First Nation peoples want self-goverment?
    </h3>
    <!--This is my paragraph tag about why do Indigenous people want self-governance -->
    <p class="center-text">
      Many Indigenous people in the province and the country see
      self-government as a way to preserve their culture and attain
      greater control over their land, resources, and administration
      of laws and practices that affect their lives.
