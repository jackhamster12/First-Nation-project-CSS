    <p>
      This fall has been marked with acts of violence and intimidation
      by non-Indigenous commercial fishers against members of the
      Miâ€™kmaq Nation in Nova Scotia seeking to carry out their treaty
      right to fish. These actions, and the accompanying inaction on
      the part of law enforcement officials, are a stark reminder that
      racism remains a persistent part of Canadian society. They also
      point to another significant barrier to the processes of
      decolonization and reconciliation the ongoing failure of the
      federal and provincial governments in Canada to uphold and
      implement treaties between Indigenous Peoples and the Crown.

    <h3>What are Land Claim Agreements?</h3>
    <p>
      Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claims
      Agreements, are concluded over long periods of time and contain
      a high level of detail. These sophisticated agreements are
      typically tripartite, including Indigenous organizations or
      nations, the Crown, and provincial/territorial governments as
      signatories.
