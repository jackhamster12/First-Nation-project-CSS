        In this project I will be talking about Treaty One. Treaty one
        was home to many different First Nations groups the likes of
        Peguis First Nation, Long Plain First Nation,Sandy Bay Ojibway
        First Nation and many others.
      </p>
      <!--This is my second paragraph-->
      <p>
        What was included in the Treaty 1: Canada was formed with the
        shared promises of peace, friendship and mutual respect with
        First Nations in the presence of all of creation. These
        promises, for as long as the sun shines, the rivers flow and
        the grass grows, are to be in effect for peoples now and for
        those yet unborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treaty No. 1 was the first of the numbered treaties that
        helped establish Western Canada, and was made with the
        understanding that the Treaty would be in place for “as long
        as the sun shines, the grass grows and the river flows”
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claims
        Agreements, are concluded over long periods of time and
        contain a high level of detail. These sophisticated agreements
        are typically tripartite, including Indigenous organizations
        or nations, the Crown, and provincial/territorial governments
        as signatories.
