          Treaty No. 1 was the first of the numbered treaties that
          helped establish Western Canada, and was made with the
          understanding that the Treaty would be in place for “as long
          as the sun shines, the grass grows and the river flows”. The
          treaties laid out where lands reserved for settlers and
          original peoples would be. Promises were made for schools to
          be built for each community, for a modest annuity of between
          $3 and $5 for each “Indian” and for items such as twine,
          ploughs, boars and oxen for some elected Chiefs, headmen and
          councillors.
