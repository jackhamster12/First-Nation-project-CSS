      Treaty No. 1 was the first of the numbered treaties that helped
      establish Western Canada, and was made with the understanding
      that the Treaty would be in place for “as long as the sun
      shines, the grass grows and the river flows”. The treaties laid
      out where lands reserved for settlers and original peoples would
      be. Promises were made for schools to be built for each
      community, for a modest annuity of between $3 and $5 for each
      “Indian” and for items such as twine, ploughs, boars and oxen
      for some elected Chiefs, headmen and councillors.
